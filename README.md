## About

This project focuses on leveraging contextualized embeddings, particularly BERT-based embeddings, for dependency parsing. Dependency parsing is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), involving the analysis of syntactic structures within sentences to identify the relationships between words. Contextualized embeddings, such as those generated by BERT, have shown significant improvements in various NLP tasks due to their ability to capture rich contextual information.

## Usage

To perform dependency parsing with contextualized embeddings, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Dataset:** Prepare your dataset in the appropriate format for dependency parsing. This typically involves annotating sentences with syntactic dependencies or obtaining datasets already annotated for this task.

2. **Tokenize and Preprocess Data:** Use the provided scripts or functions to tokenize and preprocess your data. This may include tasks such as tokenization, matching labels, and filtering non-projective trees.

3. **Train Dependency Parser Model:** Train the dependency parser model using the provided training scripts or functions. This involves feeding the preprocessed data into the neural network model and optimizing its parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms.

4. **Evaluate Model Performance:** Evaluate the trained model on validation and test datasets to assess its performance. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's effectiveness in parsing syntactic dependencies.

5. **Analyze Results and Error Patterns:** Analyze the results and error patterns to gain insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses. This may involve examining misclassified sentences, identifying common error patterns, and exploring potential improvements to the model architecture or training process.

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation or comments within the code files.
